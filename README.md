# JAGS Python and R Fun

A repository for experimenting with JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler) using both Python and R.

## Development Container

This repository includes a development container configuration with:

- Ubuntu 22.04 as the base
- Python 3 with scientific packages (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scipy)
- R with common data science packages (ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr)
- JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler)
- Interfaces for both languages (pyjags for Python, rjags for R)
- JupyterLab for interactive notebooks

### Getting Started

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
2. Install the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
3. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
4. Clone this repository
5. Open the repository in VS Code
6. When prompted to "Reopen in Container", click "Reopen in Container" or use the command palette (F1) and select "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"

The first time you open the container, it will build the Docker image and install all dependencies, which may take a few minutes.
